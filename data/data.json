Though the phone supports 27 watt fast charging and if a 27watt fast charger is used the battery can be charged in around 1 hour 15 mins or 20 mins. Moreove with that charger you can charger around 55% of your battery in just 30 mins. So it would be great if that charger was provided by Xiaomi. But keeping in mind the low cost of the phone it's still a great deal. Moreover, you can buy that 27 watt charger from mi store for just 1000 rs so my suggestion is to go for that charger and use the full potential of your phone.", "Camera: I'm really impressed with rear camera of this phone. I have compared it with my friend's realme X2 pro phone and this phone is handsomely beating the rear camera of realme X2 pro. The only area where this camera needs improvement is night photography. Though selfie camera wasn't that great. I still think Xiaomi can improve the performance of front camera with a software update. Considering the great potrait shots, wide angle shots and zommed in shots captured by this phone i will give it 8/10. If i have to rate the rear camera only i will give it a 10/10 as this phone is a beast in daylight photography and can easily beat the few high-end expensive phones.", "OS: I wasn't a big fan of MIUI but now the OS has improved significantly. This phone is running on latest android 10 with MIUI 11. I'm not seeing any ads in MIUI 11 which is great and this OS is highly customisable so I'm gonna give it a 9/10. I have deducted 1 star for few bloatware apps that can't be removed from the phone. But overall the MIUI 11 is smooth and gives you a tons of features which is really cool.", "Call quality, network reception and wifi speed: I have to say that the network reception is excellent in this device which is the most important thing for me. The network reception in my house is prettty bad and most of the phone's failed in network connectivity but this one is a beast. It has a great network reception and the call quality of the the phone is just outstanding. The wifi speed you get in this device is unmatched and i am just loving it.", "Audio quality: The audio quality of this phone is great you can listen to Hi Resolution audio songs with ease if you use a earphone that supports high resolution. I'm really happy with the audio quality and it is one of the best. Speaker volume is loud and clear. It has a single bottom firing speaker but it's not gonna disappoint you. I will give it a 10/10 in audio section.", "So lets look at the overall ratings:", "Display : 10/10", "Battery performance: 10/10", "Fast charging: 8/10", "Ram management: 10/10", "Booting time : 10/10", "Wifi speed: 10/10", "Network reception: 10/10", "Call quality: 10/10", "Wifi speed: 10/10", "Rear camera: 10/10", "Selfie camera: 7/10", "Video recording 8.5/10", "Audio quality: 10/10", "It's a value for money phone and I'm gonna give it a 10/10 in value for money section. I recommend you to go for 128 gb storgage and 6 gb ram variant as it will give you more value for money. The cost of 128 gb/6gb varient is 25000 and in deals you can easily get it at around 24000. Moreover, if you exchange an older cheap handset with this one you can significantly reduce the overall cost. I have exchanged my old device and bought this one for 18148 rs.", "So just go for it.\n", "\n  Best of the best\n"]},

However there are some flaws which I witnessed over my experience till date. So let me provide you the Pros and Cons of the phone -", "PROS...", "1. Nice built quality and comfortable to hold.", "2. Excellent performance.", "3. Symmetric stereo speakers. (Better experience while watching videos or playing games)", "4. Nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack.", "5. Up to the mark 90Hz refresh rate display.", "6. Amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun.", "7. Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour. (In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. )", "8. Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.", "9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.", "10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date.", "CONS...", "1. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.", "2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. (Reason being in many countries like UAE it is illegal to have call recording apps or VPN apps. )", "3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)", "4. Outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware. (The 20 MP front camera and that too without EIS, 2 MP macro camera, 2 MP depth camera and 13 MP ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a 2020 flagship phone with the price of 50k.)", "5. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.", "6. Misses out a 3.5 mm Jack and also the c type to 3.5 mm Jack converter provided in the box doesn't seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression.", "7. Though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from 108 MP camera.", "8. I felt that the call quality is not up to the mark. (Maybe just in my case)", "Pricing issues - Though there are two things which have gone against Xiaomi as well as other Mobile brands", "1) Increment in GST rates from 12% to 18%", "2) Higher import duties for imported phones.", "I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k.  Even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k.

I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth.

It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone.

Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.", "==== Video ====", "If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers.

I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru.

Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour.

Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.", "9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.", "10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date.", "CONS...", "1. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.", "2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. (Reason being in many countries like UAE it is illegal to have call recording apps or VPN apps. )", "3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)", "4. Outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware. (The 20 MP front camera and that too without EIS, 2 MP macro camera, 2 MP depth camera and 13 MP ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a 2020 flagship phone with the price of 50k.)", "5. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.", "6. Misses out a 3.5 mm Jack and also the c type to 3.5 mm Jack converter provided in the box doesn't seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression.", "7. Though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from 108 MP camera.", "8. I felt that the call quality is not up to the mark. (Maybe just in my case)", "Pricing issues - Though there are two things which have gone against Xiaomi as well as other Mobile brands", "1) Increment in GST rates from 12% to 18%", "2) Higher import duties for imported phones.", "I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k.  Even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k.

If you are a moderate user you can easily use it for about 1 day easily. There's a bit drop in battery performance with MIUI11.0.3 update but it has improved the overall Performance significantly and to be honest the drop is marginal about 4-5%. I wasn't that impressed with the fast charging via 18 watt charger supplied by Xiaomi with the phone. It takes around 1 hours 35 or 40 mins in fully charging the phone. Though the phone supports 27 watt fast charging and if a 27watt fast charger is used the battery can be charged in around 1 hour 15 mins or 20 mins. Moreove with that charger you can charger around 55% of your battery in just 30 mins. So it would be great if that charger was provided by Xiaomi. But keeping in mind the low cost of the phone it's still a great deal. Moreover, you can buy that 27 watt charger from mi store for just 1000 rs so my suggestion is to go for that charger and use the full potential of your phone.", "Camera: I'm really impressed with rear camera of this phone. I have compared it with my friend's realme X2 pro phone and this phone is handsomely beating the rear camera of realme X2 pro. The only area where this camera needs improvement is night photography. Though selfie camera wasn't that great. I still think Xiaomi can improve the performance of front camera with a software update. Considering the great potrait shots, wide angle shots and zommed in shots captured by this phone i will give it 8/10. If i have to rate the rear camera only i will give it a 10/10 as this phone is a beast in daylight photography and can easily beat the few high-end expensive phones.", "OS: I wasn't a big fan of MIUI but now the OS has improved significantly. This phone is running on latest android 10 with MIUI 11. I'm not seeing any ads in MIUI 11 which is great and this OS is highly customisable so I'm gonna give it a 9/10. I have deducted 1 star for few bloatware apps that can't be removed from the phone.

Its really a great deal.", "And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.", "Got for it Guys !!!\n", "\n  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren\u2019t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren\u2019t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don\u2019t regret after.\n"]},

Even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k.

If you are a moderate user you can easily use it for about 1 day easily. There's a bit drop in battery performance with MIUI11.0.3 update but it has improved the overall Performance significantly and to be honest the drop is marginal about 4-5%. I wasn't that impressed with the fast charging via 18 watt charger supplied by Xiaomi with the phone. It takes around 1 hours 35 or 40 mins in fully charging the phone. Though the phone supports 27 watt fast charging and if a 27watt fast charger is used the battery can be charged in around 1 hour 15 mins or 20 mins. Moreove with that charger you can charger around 55% of your battery in just 30 mins. So it would be great if that charger was provided by Xiaomi.

Moreover, you can buy that 27 watt charger from mi store for just 1000 rs so my suggestion is to go for that charger and use the full potential of your phone.", "Camera: I'm really impressed with rear camera of this phone. I have compared it with my friend's realme X2 pro phone and this phone is handsomely beating the rear camera of realme X2 pro. The only area where this camera needs improvement is night photography. Though selfie camera wasn't that great. I still think Xiaomi can improve the performance of front camera with a software update. Considering the great potrait shots, wide angle shots and zommed in shots captured by this phone i will give it 8/10. If i have to rate the rear camera only i will give it a 10/10 as this phone is a beast in daylight photography and can easily beat the few high-end expensive phones.", "OS: I wasn't a big fan of MIUI but now the OS has improved significantly. This phone is running on latest android 10 with MIUI 11. I'm not seeing any ads in MIUI 11 which is great and this OS is highly customisable so I'm gonna give it a 9/10. I have deducted 1 star for few bloatware apps that can't be removed from the phone.

Excellent performance.", "3. Symmetric stereo speakers. (Better experience while watching videos or playing games)", "4. Nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack.", "5. Up to the mark 90Hz refresh rate display.", "6. Amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun.", "7. Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour. (In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. )", "8. Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.", "9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.", "10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date.", "CONS...", "1. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.", "2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. (Reason being in many countries like UAE it is illegal to have call recording apps or VPN apps. )", "3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)", "4. Outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware. (The 20 MP front camera and that too without EIS, 2 MP macro camera, 2 MP depth camera and 13 MP ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a 2020 flagship phone with the price of 50k.)", "5. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.", "6. Misses out a 3.5 mm Jack and also the c type to 3.5 mm Jack converter provided in the box doesn't seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression.", "7. Though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from 108 MP camera.", "8. I felt that the call quality is not up to the mark. (Maybe just in my case)", "Pricing issues - Though there are two things which have gone against Xiaomi as well as other Mobile brands", "1) Increment in GST rates from 12% to 18%", "2) Higher import duties for imported phones.", "I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k.  Even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k.

I use my phone mostly for watching videos on youtube and binge watching on Amazon prime so I'm really happy with this phone's display. Viewing angles and deeper blacks in the display are amazing.

If you haven't used 90hz display is past then you won't gonna miss anything.", "Performance: It's a beast when it comes to day to day usage. Ram management is great. There's no lag at all. Thanks to the UFS 2.0 storage, the app opening time is very less. The phone boot time is very less and can opened in just few seconds. Gaming performance is great there's no lag at all. You will love playing heavy games Asphalt 9, Call of duty and pubg on it. Phone's has all the sensors in it and picking up all the right spots. Processor is 855 Snapdragon which is the flagship and it won't disappoint you.", "Battery life: I'm a power user so my phone's battery last for about 6-7 hours which is great. If you are a moderate user you can easily use it for about 1 day easily. There's a bit drop in battery performance with MIUI11.0.3 update but it has improved the overall Performance significantly and to be honest the drop is marginal about 4-5%. I wasn't that impressed with the fast charging via 18 watt charger supplied by Xiaomi with the phone. It takes around 1 hours 35 or 40 mins in fully charging the phone. Though the phone supports 27 watt fast charging and if a 27watt fast charger is used the battery can be charged in around 1 hour 15 mins or 20 mins. Moreove with that charger you can charger around 55% of your battery in just 30 mins. So it would be great if that charger was provided by Xiaomi. But keeping in mind the low cost of the phone it's still a great deal. Moreover, you can buy that 27 watt charger from mi store for just 1000 rs so my suggestion is to go for that charger and use the full potential of your phone.", "Camera: I'm really impressed with rear camera of this phone. I have compared it with my friend's realme X2 pro phone and this phone is handsomely beating the rear camera of realme X2 pro. The only area where this camera needs improvement is night photography. Though selfie camera wasn't that great. I still think Xiaomi can improve the performance of front camera with a software update. Considering the great potrait shots, wide angle shots and zommed in shots captured by this phone i will give it 8/10. If i have to rate the rear camera only i will give it a 10/10 as this phone is a beast in daylight photography and can easily beat the few high-end expensive phones.", "OS: I wasn't a big fan of MIUI but now the OS has improved significantly. This phone is running on latest android 10 with MIUI 11. I'm not seeing any ads in MIUI 11 which is great and this OS is highly customisable so I'm gonna give it a 9/10. I have deducted 1 star for few bloatware apps that can't be removed from the phone. But overall the MIUI 11 is smooth and gives you a tons of features which is really cool.", "Call quality, network reception and wifi speed: I have to say that the network reception is excellent in this device which is the most important thing for me.

I'm really happy with the audio quality and it is one of the best. Speaker volume is loud and clear. It has a single bottom firing speaker but it's not gonna disappoint you.

Need to return  fast", "Very very bad experience\n", "\n  The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .\n", "\n  In my opinion, don\u2019t  think much about the phone , just get it . I am attaching night-mode on and off pictures. Check the difference", "Pros-", "1. Best Camera", "2. Best Security", "3. Long day Battery Life", "4. Touch ID improved", "5. Its an iPhone after all . \ud83d\ude0d", "6. Best Night-mode support", "7. Best Processors A13 Bionic Chip", "Cons-", "1. Display could have been OLED in this price but if doesn\u2019t matter . This retina lcd is really awesome.", "2. Slightly bulky and weighty - if u r shifting from iPhone 7 or 8", "3. Thick bezels", "Guys , I am both Samsung as well as iPhone fan. But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.", "And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.", "Got for it Guys !!!\n", "\n  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren\u2019t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren\u2019t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don\u2019t regret after.\n"]},
